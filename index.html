                Welcome to my developmental blog! I am Josh, and the objective of this blog of mine is to share
                with you all about the cool and interesting stuff I have learnt from this exciting module, called
                Interactive Development. I would be covering each week, from week 1 to 18, about the things I have
                learnt and the knowledge I have gained over the weeks.

            <h2 class="contentHeader">A Brief Idea About What Web Development Is</h2>
            <p>
                I was given a brief idea about what web development is. To start off, web development
                consists of 3 different roles of developers. Developers who specialize in the behaviour
                and user interface of the site (front-end), those who write the underlying code for
                running all website operations (back-end), and those who manage all aspects of a website
                (full-stack). Web development involves the work of developing websites, where the web developers
                would then publish it on the internet for users and others to view or interact with. While web
                developers create its contents and design the websites, they are also responsible for maintaining
                websites, as well as its technical detail, such as its performance, which are measures of a
                website's loading speed and so on. Sites that have good performance typically have more user traffic
                and increased conversion rates.
            </p>

            <h2 class="contentHeader">The Roles of a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, web development is split into 3 categories. We will now go more into detail
                of each role of the 3 different types of web developers.
