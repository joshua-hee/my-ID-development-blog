                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. A Brief Idea About What Web Development Is</h2>
                <p>
                    During the first week, I was given a brief idea about what web development is. To start off, web development
                    consists of 3 different roles of developers. Developers who specialize in the behaviour
                    and user interface of the site (front-end), those who write the underlying code for
                    running all website operations (back-end), and those who manage all aspects of a website
                    (full-stack). Web development involves the work of developing websites, where the web developers
                    would then publish it on the internet for users and others to view or interact with. While web
                    developers create its contents and design the websites, they are also responsible for maintaining
                    websites, as well as its technical detail, such as its performance, which are measures of a
                    website's loading speed and so on. Sites that have good performance typically have more user traffic
                    and increased conversion rates.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. The Roles of a Web Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, web development is split into 3 categories. We will now go more into detail
                    of each role of the 3 different types of web developers.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>FRONTEND DEVELOPERS</th>
                        <th>BAKCENED DEVELOPERS</th>
                        <th>FULLSTACK DEVELOPERS</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Code and design the frontend of a website. This is the part which the users see and interact with.</td>
                        <td>Working behind the scenes and maintaining the the performance and technology needed to power the front end.</td>
                        <td>Experts in both frontend and backend development.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Bring the designs to life with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</td>
                        <td>Ensure that everything the frontend developer developed is properly functioning.</td>
                        <td>Provide guidance on strategy and best practices.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Ensure responsive design throughout different devices or platforms.</td>
                        <td>Create and manage the databases.</td>
                        <td>Well-versed in both business logic and user experience.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, along with CSS and Javascript, are the 3 core pillars of front frontend development.
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is basically a set tags which define the structure,
                    and format of the web contents, and it utilizes tags and attributes to describe how the content of
                    a web page should be displayed or formatted.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for beautifying the
                    looks of a website. It allows users to add styles, such as colours, fonts, animations, layouts,
                    and more, to web pages. Users are able to control the layout and presentation of multiple
                    webpages at once, making it easier to maintain and update the design of their websites.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a programming language used to enable websites to be interactive. Users can add dynamic
                    behaviour, such as animated effects, and create complex features like forms, that can be submitted or
                    used to store data. It can also be used to make a website respond to user interaction, like clicking a
                    button or scrolling through the web page, allowing the user experience to be more engaging.
                </p>

                    <li>Web Gradients</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. Semantic Web</h2>
                <p>
                    The Semantic Web concept is proposed to enhance way web content is shared and understood by machines.
                    The idea is to create a web where the meaning and context of the content is fully captured and represented
                    in machine-readable format, so that computers can process and understand the data efficiently.
                    Some Examples include the div element. It does not inheritently represent anything. It should be used only
                    when no ohter semantic element is appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To summarize, semantics relates to syntax. It is the meaning
                    behind words, phrases and so on. In this case, it is the HTML. Seach engines looks for keywords by looking
                    through the semantics in our codes. Therefore, it is important to have Semantic HTML as it not only make the
                    codes easier to understand, but also because screen readers (accessibility feature) and browsers can
                    interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. CSS Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    A CSS rule is a set of instructions that specify how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. It
                    defines the styles for font, colour, size, padding, margin, and other properties of an HTML element. The
                    CSS rule consists of two parts. A selector, which defines the HTML element to be styled, and a declaration,
                    which specifies the styles to be applied.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. The Different Methods to Apply CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    There are 3 ways to apply CSS to a web page. Firstly, using external stylesheets. This method involves
                    creating a seperate .css file which links it to the HTML document. This is the most commonly used
                    (and preferred) method as it allows for easy maintenance and consistency throught the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internal stylesheets can also be used. This method involves adding CSS styles within the head of the HTML 
                    document using a style tag. This method can be useful for small websites or quick testing of styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, inline styles. This method involves adding CSS styles directly to HTML elements using the "style"
                    attribute. However, this method is not recommended and should therefore be used sparingly as it goes against
                    the seperation of structure and presenation.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. The Different Ways to Apply Colours</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several ways to apply colours in CSS:
                </p>
                <p>- Named Colours: Using color names such as red, blue, green, etc. to specify colors.</p>
                <p>- RGB Colours: Using the RGB value to specify colors, such as rgb(255,0,0) for red.</p>
                <p>- HEX Colors: Using the hexadecimal value to specify colors, such as #FF0000 for red.</p>
                <p>- HSL Colors: Using the HSL value to specify colors, such as hsl(0, 100%, 50%) for red.</p>
                <p>- RGBA Colors: Using the RGBA value to specify colors, such as rgba(255,0,0,1) for red with full opacity.</p>
                <p>- Gradients: Using CSS gradients to create a gradual transition between two or more colors.</p>
                <p>- Transparent Colors: Using the transparent keyword to make an element transparent.</p>
                <p>
                    These color methods can be applied to different CSS properties such as background-color, color, border-color, etc. to change the appearance of an element.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. ID and Class Attributes</h2>
                <p>
                    ID and Class attributes are used in HTML to identify specific elements and apply styles to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ID attribute is used to give a unique identity to a specific element. Only one element can have a
                    particular ID on a page, and an ID can only be used once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Class attribute, on the other hand, is used to group elements with similar styles. Unlike the ID attribute, a class can be applied to multiple elements
                    on a page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In CSS, users can target elements with the ID attribute using the "#" symbol followed by the ID name, and target elements with the Class attribute using the "."
                    symbol followed by the Class name
                </p>
                <p>In general, ID is used when users want to target a specific, unique element, while Class is used when users want to target multiple elements with the same style.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">6. Pseudo Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Pseudo classes in CSS are special keywords that can be added to selectors to select elements based on their state or position in the document. They allow users to
                    style an element in a specific way when it's in a certain state or condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the ":hover" pseudo class allows users to change the style of an element when the mouse pointer is over it. The ":active" pseudo class allows you to
                    change the style of an element when it's being clicked. The ":focus" pseudo class allows you to change the style of an element when it has focus, such as when it is
                    selected for typing.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">7. Font Stacking</h2>
                <p>
                    Font stacking is a technique in web design where multiple font families are declared for the same element in a web page. It is done to ensure that if the first font
                    family is not available on the user's device, the next font family in the list will be used as a fallback. The idea behind font stacking is to provide an appropriate
                    and readable font for the content, even if the user's device does not have the preferred font installed.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">8. Box Model</h2>
                <p>
                    The box model is a concept in CSS that describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and the boxes' dimensions, including their
                    content, padding, borders, and margins. The box model is used to calculate the size and position of an element's content and its surrounding elements, such as padding,
                    borders, and margins. The dimensions of the boxes are used to calculate how much space an element takes up on the page, as well as how other elements are positioned in
                    relation to it. Therefore, users should understand the box model for correctly styling and positioning elements in a web page.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">9. Web Gradients</h2>
                <p>
                    Web gradients is the use of gradient color effects in web design. A gradient is a gradual transition from one color to another. In web design, gradients can be
                    applied to elements such as background, buttons, and text to create a more visually appealing design. Web gradients can be created using CSS, and there are several types
                    of gradient effects, including linear, radial, and conic gradients. The use of web gradients helps to create a smooth, blended look and can add depth and dimension to a
                    design. Web gradients can also be used to create a unique visual identity for a website or application.

                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. The Form Tag</h2>
                <p>
                    The form tag is an HTML tag used to create a form for collecting information from a user. It is an element used for creating interactive web pages where users can
                    enter and submit information. This tag contains various form elements such as text input, radio buttons, checkboxes, and drop-down menus, and it allows users to
                    enter data and submit it to a server for processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The form tag has many different attributes, such as action, method, and even enctype. The action attribute specifies the URL of the script or server-side program that will handle
                    the form data when it is submitted. The method attribute specifies the HTTP method used to submit the form, which is usually either GET or POST.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the form tag, web developers can create interactive web pages that allow users to submit data and interact with web applications.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. The Input Tag</h2>
                <p>
                    Now to delve in deeper into some of the capabilities of the input tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The input tag is an HTML element used to create a variety of form controls, such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons,
                    and more. The input element is a self-closing tag that can be used without a closing tag.
                </p>
                    The type attribute of the input tag determines the type of input control to create. Some common values for the type attribute are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    text: Creates a single-line text input field.
                    password: Creates a single-line text input field where the characters are hidden.
                    checkbox: Creates a checkbox control.
                    radio: Creates a radio button control.
                    submit: Creates a submit button for the form.
                    button: Creates a generic button that can be used for a variety of purposes.
                    file: Creates a file upload control.
                    number: Creates a numeric input field.
                    date: Creates a date input field.
                    email: Creates an email input field.
                    url: Creates a URL input field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many other values for the type attribute, depending on the specific type of input control the user want to create. Additionally,
                    users can use other attributes like name, value, placeholder, required, and more to customize the behavior and appearance of the input element.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. The Label Tag</h2>
                <p>
                    The HTML <label> element is used to associate a text label with a form element, such as an input field, select box, or text area. This helps to
                    make the form more accessible, understandable and user-friendly by allowing users to click on the label to activate the form element.
                </p>
                <p>The label tag has two main purposes:</p>
                <p>1. To provide a text label for an associated form element</p>
                <p>2. To improve the accessibility and usability of a form by making it easier for users to interact with form elements</p>
                <p>To associate a label with an input element, the "for" attribute is used. The "for" attribute value should be set to the "id" attribute value of the input element.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. The "required" Attribute</h2>
                <p>
                    Used for validations, the "required" attribute is an HTML attribute that can be added to a form element to indicate that the field is required and must be filled out
                    before submitting the form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this attribute is added to an input element, the browser will prevent the form from being submitted if the field is empty. It will also display an error message
                    asking the user to fill out the required field.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. Nested Elements and the DOM</h2>
                <p>
                    Nested elements are HTML elements that are placed inside other HTML elements, forming a hierarchical structure. For example, a paragraph element (p) can contain
                    text and other elements, such as links (a), images (img), and span elements (span).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style,
                    and content. The DOM represents the document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or piece of text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the DOM, each element in the HTML document is represented by a node. The parent node of an element is the element that contains it, and the child nodes of an element are the
                    elements contained within it. This nesting of elements allows us to create complex web pages with a hierarchical structure, where elements can be styled and manipulated individually or as a group.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">6. Descendant Selector</h2>
                <p>
                    Descendant selectors in CSS allow users to select an element that is a descendant of another element. It is also called a child selector. It selects all elements that are inside a
                    specific element, regardless of how many levels deep the selected elements are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The descendant selector uses whitespace to separate the parent element and the child element. For example, div p selects all p elements that are descendants of div elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Descendant selectors are useful when applying a style to a specific element that is nested within another element. They allow users to target specific elements without using complex
                    class names or IDs. Despite being allowed to go as many levels the user want with descendent selectors, it is recommended to use at most 3 levels.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">7. Grouping Selectors</h2>
                <p>
                    Users can apply the same set of styles to multiple selectors by grouping them together. To group selectors, just simply separate each selector with a comma (,).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grouping selectors can be useful for simplifying CSS code and making it more concise. It can also help to make styles more modular and reusable, as users can apply the same set of
                    styles to multiple elements throughout the HTML document.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">8. Inheritance</h2>
                <p>
                    Inheritance is a key concept in CSS that allows properties of a parent element to be passed down to its child elements. When a property is not explicitly set on a child element, the
                    browser looks up the hierarchy of the DOM to find a parent element that has that property set. If found, it will use that value as the default value for the child element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This makes it much easier to style large sections of a website without having to repeat the same styles over and over again. For example, if a person has a website with multiple pages that
                    all use the same font and font size, you can set the font and font size on the body element and it will be inherited by all child elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, not all CSS properties are inherited. Some properties, like background-color and border, are not inherited by default.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">9. Specificity</h2>
                <p>Specificity is a way of determining which CSS rule gets applied to an element when more than one rule could potentially apply. It is a measure of the specificity of the selectors used in the rule.</p>
                <p>
                    Specificity is based on a combination of the number of ID, class, and element selectors used in the selector, with ID selectors having the highest specificity, followed by class selectors and then
                    element selectors. The more specific a selector is, the more weight it carries when determining which rule applies to an element.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">10. Cascade</h2>
                <p>
                    In CSS, the cascade refers to the way that styles are applied to an HTML document, based on specificity. The cascade is a set of rules that determine which styles will be applied to an element.
                    The cascade is based on three factors: specificity, source order, and importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specificity refers to how specific a style is to a particular element or set of elements. For example, a style rule that applies to a specific class (e.g. .my-class) has a higher specificity than
                    a rule that applies to all elements of a certain type (e.g. p).
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">11. Importance using "!important"</h2>
                <p>
                    "!important" is a CSS declaration that can be added to a property to give it more importance or specificity than other declarations that might apply to the same element. When a property is marked
                    with "!important", it overrides other declarations that might apply to the same element, regardless of their specificity or order in the stylesheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is usually best to use "!important" sparingly, as it can make CSS harder to maintain and override in the future. Generally, it is better to use specific selectors or better organization of the
                    CSS to achieve the desired styling. However, there may be certain cases where "!important" is necessary, such as when overriding styles from third-party libraries or plugins. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">12. Background</h2>
                <p>
                    The background property in CSS is used to set the background color and image of an HTML element. It is a shorthand property that combines several other background-related properties like "background-color",
                    "background-image", "background-size", "background-repeat", as well as a few others.
                </p>
                <p>The "background-color" property is used to set the background color of an element. It can take a color value in various formats, including named colors, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HEX codes.</p>
                <p>The "background-image" property is used to set the background image of an element. It can take an image URL, either relative or absolute.</p>
                <p>The "background-size" property is used to control the size of the background image. It can take values like cover, contain, a specific width and height in pixels, or percentages.</p>
                <p>The "background-repeat" property is used to set how the background image should be repeated. It can take values like repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">13. Border</h2>
                <p>
                    In CSS, the border property is used to set the border style, width, and color for an element. It is a shorthand property that combines the several properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The border property can have up to three values: "border-width", "border-style", and "border-color". Users can also set each of these values separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also set different values for each side of the border using the "border-top", "border-right", "border-bottom", and "border-left" properties.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">14. ID Selector</h2>
                <p>
                    An ID selector is a type of CSS selector that selects elements based on their ID attribute. The ID attribute is used to uniquely identify an element within an HTML document, and it must
                    be unique within the document. The ID selector is written with the pound sign (#) followed by the ID name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ID selectors have a high specificity, which means that they have a higher priority than other types of selectors. This is because the ID attribute is unique, so there can only be one element
                    with a particular ID. When multiple selectors apply to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity takes precedence.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">15. Class Selector</h2>
                <p>
                    A class selector is a type of CSS selector that is used to target elements based on their class attribute. The class attribute is used to group elements that share similar characteristics,
                    so that they can be targeted with CSS rules.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">16. Media Queries</h2>
                <p>
                    Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or browser that the website is being viewed on. Users can create responsive designs that adapt to
                    different screen sizes and devices, making sure that the design and layout of the website looks great no matter how it's being viewed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Media queries are a useful tool for creating responsive designs that work across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. By using media queries, users can make sure that their website looks
                    great no matter how it's being viewed, from desktops and laptops to tablets and smartphones.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">17. Positioning</h2>
                <p>
                    Positioning in CSS refers to the way elements are placed and aligned on a web page. There are different types of positioning in CSS, including static, relative, absolute, and fixed.
                </p>
                <p>Static positioning: The default positioning for all HTML elements, where the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.</p>
                <p>Relative positioning: Allows an element to be positioned relative to its normal position, which means the element can be moved from its original position by specifying a top, bottom, left, or right value.</p>
                <p>Absolute positioning: Allows an element to be positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor element. If no ancestor element is positioned, it will be positioned relative to the document body.</p>
                <p>Fixed positioning: This is similar to absolute positioning, except the element is positioned relative to the browser window instead of the document.</p>
                <p>
                    Z-index: is a property that allows users to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a web page along the z-axis, which is the axis that runs perpendicular to the screen. By default, elements are
                    layered on top of each other based on the order in which they appear in the HTML document, with the last element appearing on top of all the others. However, with z-index, you can move elements up or down in
                    the stacking order, allowing you to control which elements appear on top of others.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">18. Flexbox</h2>
                <p>
                    Flexbox is a layout model in CSS which allows you to align and distribute elements along a single row or column. It provides an easy way to create responsive layouts by adjusting the position, size, and order
                    of elements within a container, without the need for complex positioning techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flexbox is based on the concept of flex containers and flex items. A flex container is an element that contains one or more flex items, and is defined using the "display: flex" or "display: inline-flex" property.
                    The flex items inside the container can be arranged in different ways, using various properties such as "flex-direction", "flex-wrap", "justify-content", and "align-items".
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">19. Wireframes</h2>
                <p>
                    Wireframes are a visual representation of the basic layout and structure of a website or application. They are used to plan and organize the content and functionality of a website or application, as well as to
                    illustrate the relationships between different components and the overall flow of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wireframes are usually created during the early stages of the design process, before more detailed visual designs are developed. They can be simple sketches or more detailed diagrams, depending on the needs of
                    the project. Wireframes can be created using a variety of tools, including pen and paper, whiteboards, or specialized software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are mainly 2 types of fidelity for wireframes. It refers to the level of detail and interactivity included in the design. The types of fidelity are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Low-fidelity wireframes: These are simple, black-and-white designs that provide a rough idea of the layout, content, and functionality of the website or app. They are quick and easy to create, and they allow designers
                    to focus on the basic structure and flow of the design. However, low-fidelity wireframes may not provide enough detail for stakeholders to fully understand the design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    High-fidelity wireframes: These wireframes are more detailed and interactive than the other two types. They include color, typography, and more advanced functionality, such as dropdown menus, search bars, and hover
                    effects. High-fidelity wireframes are more time-consuming to create, but they provide a more accurate representation of the final design, making it easier for stakeholders to visualize the end product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pros and cons of each type of fidelity are as follows:
                </p>
                <p>1. Low-fidelity wireframes (Pros): Quick and easy to create, allow designers to focus on the structure and flow of the design.</p>
                <p>2. Low-fidelity wireframes (Cons): May not provide enough detail for stakeholders to fully understand the design.</p>
                <p>3. High-fidelity wireframes (Pros): Provide a more accurate representation of the final design, making it easier for stakeholders to visualize the end product.</p>
                <p>4. High-fidelity wireframe (Cons): More time-consuming to create, may be too detailed for early stages of the design process, can be too constraining for certain types of designs.</p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of wireframes is to provide a clear and organized structure for the website or application, and to help designers and developers identify and resolve potential issues before the project moves into
                    the more detailed design and development phases. By creating a wireframe, designers can quickly and easily test and refine different layouts and designs, and ensure that the final product is functional,
                    user-friendly, and meets the needs of the project stakeholders.

                <h2 class="contentHeader">20. Grid System</h2>
                <p>Grid Systems are a layout structure that is used to arrange content on a web page. It is a system of rows and columns that helps to create a balance between the design and content of the page.</p>
                <p>
                    In this system, a web page is divided into a series of equal-sized columns. The number of columns can vary depending on the design requirements, but most grid systems use 12 columns as a standard. The columns
                    are then arranged in rows, which can also be of different heights depending on the content.
                </p>
                <p>There are two main types of grid systems: fixed and fluid. A fixed grid system has a set width for the columns, while a fluid grid system uses a percentage width for the columns.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. Responsive Images</h2>
                <p>
                    Responsive images are images that are optimized to adapt to different screen sizes and device types, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The goal of responsive images is to ensure
                    that images are displayed in the best possible quality and resolution on any device, without compromising on performance or download speeds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the methods that can be used to make images responsive are:
                </p>
                <p>1. Using CSS media queries to apply different styles or sizes to the image depending on the device size.</p>
                <p>2. Using the HTML srcset attribute to specify a range of image sizes and resolutions to choose from.</p>
                <p>3. Using the HTML sizes attribute to specify the available sizes for the image.</p>
                <p>4. Using JavaScript to dynamically load the correct image size based on the device and screen size.</p>
                <p>
                    The use of responsive images can help improve the user experience on your website by ensuring that images are displayed in the optimal quality for each user, regardless of their device or screen size.
                    This can lead to increased engagement, higher conversion rates, and better overall user satisfaction.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. Git</h2>
                <p>
                    Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among multiple people. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>Git allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time without interfering with each other's changes. It provides a way to keep track of all changes made to a project and provides a way to easily roll back to previous versions if necessary.</p>
                <p>One of the key features of Git is its ability to create branches. A branch is a separate copy of a project that can be worked on independently of the main project. This allows developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main project.</p>
                <p>Git is often used in conjunction with GitHub, a web-based hosting service for version control. GitHub provides a central location for storing Git repositories and allows developers to collaborate on code and manage issues and pull requests.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. Important Git Commands</h2>
                <p>Some of the important Git commands I have learnt this week are:</p>
                <p>1. git clone: Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.</p>
                <p>2. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.</p>
                <p>3. git add: Adds changes to the staging area, which prepares them for committing.</p>
                <p>4. git status: Shows the status of the current branch.</p>
                <p>5. git commit: Commits the changes to the local repository.</p>
                <p>6. git log: Shows a log of all commits in the current branch.</p>
                <p>7. git mv: Used to rename or move files in the Git repository.</p>
                <p>8. git rm: Used to remove a file or directory from the Git repository.</p>
                <p>9. git push: Pushes the local commits to a remote repository.</p>
                <p>10. git pull: Pulls changes from a remote repository to the local repository.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. JavaScript Essential Training</h2>
                <p>
                    Week 5 is a whitespace week. We were given the time to do some self-learning on a few topics on JavaScript basics. I learnt about objects, srting outputs
                    and DOM (Document Object Model). 
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. Ways to place JavaScript files</h2>
                <p>
                    1. Inline: Users can add JavaScript code directly in the HTML document by using the script tag with the type attribute set to "text/javascript". The JavaScript
                    code will be executed when the page is loaded, or when an event triggers it.
                </p>
                <p>2. Internal: You can also add JavaScript code within the script tags in the head or body section of the HTML document. This is called internal JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    3. External: You can include JavaScript code from an external file using the script tag with the src attribute set to the URL of the file. This is called external
                    JavaScript and is a good practice as it allows you to separate the HTML and JavaScript code, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Event Handlers: JavaScript can also be placed within HTML elements as event handlers, using attributes such as onclick, onload, onsubmit, etc. These event
                    handlers will execute the JavaScript code when the associated event occurs.
                </p>
                <p>I learnt that The recommended way to include JavaScript in a web page is by placing the script tags at the end of the body element, just before the closing "body" tag.</p>
                <p>Some of the reasons for this approach are:</p>
                <p>
                    1. Performance: If the script is placed in the head element or at the beginning of the body element, the browser will block the rendering of the rest of the page until
                    the script has finished loading and executing. By placing the script at the end of the body element, the page can load and render without being blocked by the script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Maintainability: By placing the script at the end of the body element, it's easier to locate and manage the script as it's separate from the content and layout of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Compatibility: Some older browsers don't support the async and defer attributes for script tags, so placing the script at the end of the body element is a more widely compatible approach.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. The async and defer keyword</h2>
                <p>In HTML, the async and defer keywords are used with the script tag to specify how the script should be executed.</p>
                <p>
                    The "async" keyword tells the browser to start downloading the script in the background, and continue parsing the HTML document without waiting for the script to finish loading.
                    Once the script is downloaded, it is executed immediately, which means that the order in which the scripts are downloaded may not be the order in which they are executed.
                    This can result in unexpected behavior if scripts have dependencies on each other.
                </p>
                <div class="reference-img">
                    <img src="img/ID_reference3.PNG" alt="Types of positioning in CSS">
                </div>
                <p class="references">Source: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training</p>

                <p>
                    The "defer" keyword tells the browser to download the script in the background, and continue parsing the HTML document without waiting for the script to finish loading. However, the script
                    is not executed until the HTML document has finished parsing. This means that scripts are executed in the order in which they appear in the HTML document, and scripts that have dependencies
                    on other scripts will be executed in the correct order.
                </p>
                <div class="reference-img">
                    <img src="img/ID_reference4.PNG" alt="Types of positioning in CSS">
                </div>
                <p class="references">Source: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training</p>

                <p>
                    The recommended way to use these keywords is to use "defer" whenever possible, because it ensures that scripts are executed in the correct order, without blocking the rendering of the page.
                    If users need to use async, they should test their page thoroughly to ensure that scripts are executing in the correct order and not causing unexpected behavior.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. JavaScript Modules</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript modules are a way of organizing code in a modular and reusable way, allowing developers to break their code into small, self-contained units that can be easily imported and used
                    in other parts of their application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The import and export statements are used to work with ES6 modules. ES6 modules are recommended for modern web development due to their simplicity and ease of use. They also have built-in
                    support for asynchronous loading, which can improve the performance of large applications.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. All About Objects</h2>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, an object is a container that can hold properties and methods. Objects can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or ES6 classes. Object literals are a
                    shorthand way to create objects using curly braces {}.
                </p>
                <p>An object is a collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. A property key is always a string (or a Symbol), and the value can be any valid JavaScript value, including another object.</p>
                <p>
                    An object method is a function that is a property of an object. An object method can be called on that object to perform a specific action or to compute and return a value. Object methods can also take arguments,
                    just like regular functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Object blueprints, also known as constructor functions or classes, are templates for creating objects that share similar properties and methods. They allow users to create objects with the same structure and functionality
                    without having to write the same code over and over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can create object blueprints using constructor functions or the newer class syntax. Constructor functions are regular functions that are used with the "new" keyword to create objects, while classes provide a more
                    structured and familiar syntax for creating object blueprints. By using object blueprints like constructor functions or classes, we can create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior, which makes codes more organized and easier to maintain.
                </p>
                <p>Object constructors are functions that are used to create and initialize objects. They allow you to create many objects of the same type, and to set their initial values using arguments passed to the constructor.</p>
                <p>Using object constructors allows users to create and manage multiple objects of the same type more easily, and to reuse code by defining common properties and methods in the constructor.</p>

                <p>In JavaScript, global objects are objects that are always available in the global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the code. These objects provide useful functionality and are often used in many JavaScript programs. These are some of the most commonly used global objects:</p>
                <p>Math: The Math object provides mathematical constants and functions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic functions.</p>
                <p>Date: The Date object provides methods to create and manipulate dates and times.</p>
                <p>String: The String object provides methods for working with strings.</p>
                <p>Array: The Array object provides methods for working with arrays.</p>
                <p>JSON: The JSON object provides methods for working with JSON data, such as parsing JSON strings into JavaScript objects and vice versa.</p>
                <p>console: The console object provides methods for logging messages to the browser console.</p>
                <p>These global objects can be accessed from anywhere in the code without the need to import or require them. However, it is important to use them wisely and not to overwrite them with custom variables or functions that could cause conflicts.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">6. String Output</h2>
                <p>Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature in JavaScript that allows for easier string interpolation and multiline strings.</p>
                <p>
                    Template literals are enclosed by backticks () instead of single or double quotes, and placeholders in the form of ${expression}` can be used to embed variables or expressions within the string. The placeholders are replaced by the values of the expressions at runtime.
                    They provide a more concise and readable way to work with strings and are widely used in modern JavaScript development.
                </p>
                <p>There are also traditional string outputs, which refers to the practice of concatenating multiple strings using the + operator to form a larger string.</p>
                <p>This approach can quickly become cumbersome when dealing with multiple variables and complex strings. It can also introduce the possibility of syntax errors when using quotation marks within the string.</p>
                <p>This is why traditional string outputs are no longer the preffered of doing things, and template literals would be the preffered method as it offers a more concise and readable way of constructing strings, especially when including variables and expressions.</p>
                <p>Overall, template literals provide a more powerful and flexible way to work with strings in JavaScript.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. JS Basics Recap</h2>
                <p>The lessons in week 6 are mostly a recap of week 5. We look through again variables, statements, data types, logical operators, objects, DOM and so on.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. Variables</h2>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that stores a value. You can assign a value to a variable and then refer to the variable to use its value in your code. 
                    There are three ways to declare a variable by using the "var", "let", or "const" keyword.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what I have learnt, it is recommended to use "let" and "const" instead of var as they provide better scoping and help prevent common mistakes like redeclaring variables.
                    "let" is used for variables that may change their value, while "const" is used for variables that should not be reassigned. A thing I noted was that variables should be given
                    meaningful names and the camel case naming convention was recommended. Each variable should also have a unique name.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. Statements</h2>
                <p>
                    Each statement in JavaScript must end with a semicolon (;) to indicate the end of the statement. However, in some cases, the semicolon can be omitted, and JavaScript will automatically insert it.
                    This is known as Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI), but it is generally recommended to always include the semicolon to avoid any ambiguity in the code.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. Data Types</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript, there are several data types that are used to represent different kinds of values. Some of the most commonly used data types are:</p>
                <p>1. Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.</p>
                <p>2. String: Represents text values. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.</p>
                <p>3. Boolean: Represents true/false values.</p>
                <p>4. Null: Represents a null or empty value.</p>
                <p>5. Undefined: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.</p>
                <p>6. Object: Represents complex data structures that can contain multiple properties.</p>
                <p>7. Array: A specialized type of object used to store a collection of values.</p>
                <p>8. Function: Represents a block of reusable code that can be called from other parts of a program.</p>

                <p>Not to mention, there are also 5 primitive data types which I learnt from this week:</p>
                <p>1. Number: represents a numeric value, either integer or floating-point.</p>
                <p>2. String: represents a sequence of characters.</p>
                <p>3. Boolean: represents a logical value, either true or false.</p>
                <p>4. Undefined: represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a </p>
                <p>5. Null: represents a null value or no value.</p>
                <p>
                    These data types are considered primitive because they are not objects and do not have methods or properties. However, JavaScript treats them as objects
                    when necessary by automatically converting them to their corresponding object wrapper types (Boolean, Number, and String).
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. Dynamic Typing</h2>
                <p>
                    Dynamic typing is a feature of programming languages where the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than being explicitly declared by the programmer. In dynamically typed languages like JavaScript,
                    the type of a variable can change at any point during the execution of a program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This flexibility can make coding faster and easier, as it allows developers to write code more quickly without having to worry about type declarations or conversions. However, it can also introduce bugs and errors
                    if the programmer is not careful, as unexpected type changes can lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

                <h2 class="contentHeader">6. String Processing</h2>
                <p>
                    String processing is an important aspect of JavaScript programming, as it allows developers to work with text data in various ways. JavaScript provides a number of built-in methods and functions that can be used
                    to process and manipulate strings. Some of the most common tasks that can be performed on strings in JavaScript include:
                </p>
                <p>1. Concatenation: To concatenate, or join, two or more strings together, you can use the "+" operator</p>
                <p>2. Accessing characters: You can access individual characters within a string using bracket notation. The index of the first character in a string is 0, and the index of the last character is the length of the string -1.</p>
                <p>3. Finding the length of a string: You can use the "length" property of a string to find out how many characters it contains.</p>
                <p>4. Searching for a substring: You can search for a specific substring within a string using the "indexOf()" method. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found.</p>
                <p>5. Extracting a substring: You can extract a specific substring from a string using the "slice()" method. This method takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index of the substring.</p>
                <p>6. Converting to uppercase or lowercase: You can convert a string to uppercase or lowercase using the "toUpperCase()" and "toLowerCase()" methods.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">7. Comparison and Logical Operators</h2>
                <p>Comparison and logical operators are used in JavaScript to compare values and evaluate conditions. They are used in conditional statements, loops, and other control structures to control the flow of code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.</p>
                <p>Here are some common comparison operators in JavaScript:</p>
                <p>1. == : equal to</p>
                <p>2. != : not equal to</p>
                <p>3. &gt; : greater than</p>
                <p>4. &lt;: less than</p>
                <p>5. &gt;= : greater than or equal to</p>
                <p>6. &lt;= : less than or equal to</p>
                <p>7. === : strictly equal to</p>
                <p>8. !== : strictly not equal to</p>
                <p>The difference between == and === is that the latter performs a strict comparison, which means it compares not only the values but also the data type. For example, 1 == "1" is true, but 1 === "1" is false.</p>

                <p>Logical operators, on the other hand, are used to combine conditions and evaluate multiple conditions at once. The most common logical operators in JavaScript are:</p>
                <p>1. && : and</p>
                <p>2. || : or</p>
                <p>3. ! : not</p>
                <p>The && operator returns true if both conditions it is evaluating are true. The || operator returns true if at least one of the conditions it is evaluating is true. The "!" operator negates a condition, so if a condition is true, "!" makes it false, and if a condition is false, "! makes it true.</p>
                
                <h2 class="contentHeader">8. Casting</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript, casting is the process of converting one data type to another. This is necessary when you want to perform an operation that requires operands of a specific data type.</p>
                <p>For example, if a user has a string that represents a number, and you want to perform a mathematical operation with that number, you need to convert the string to a number first. This can be done using the Number() function or the parseInt() function.</p>
                <p>Casting can also be done implicitly in some cases. For example, if the user concatenates a string and a number using the + operator, the number will be automatically converted to a string.</p>
                
                <h2 class="contentHeader">9. For Loops</h2>
                <p>A for loop is a JavaScript loop statement that repeatedly runs a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. A for loop consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">10. While Loops</h2>
                <p>A while loop is a control flow statement in JavaScript that executes a block of code while a specified condition is true.</p>
                <p>The condition is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop is executed. This process continues until the condition becomes false, at which point control is passed to the statement following the loop.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">11. Array Indexing</h2>
                <p>Array indexing refers to the process of accessing and manipulating elements of an array using their respective indices. The indices of an array are zero-based, which means that the first element of an array has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.</p>
                <p>To access an element of an array using its index, the user can use the square bracket notation with the index inside the brackets</p>
                <p>Arrays in JavaScript have several built-in methods and properties. Some of the most commonly used ones include:</p>
                <p>1. pop(): Removes the last element from the array and returns that element.</p>
                <p>2. push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.</p>
                <p>3. shift(): Removes the first element from the array and returns that element. This also changes the length of the array.</p>
                <p>4. unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length.</p>
                <p>5. splice(): Adds or removes elements from an array.</p>
                <p>6. sort():  Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. It sorts the elements based on the Unicode character values of their string representations.</p>
                <p>7. indexOf(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the array.</p>
                <p>8. length: returns the number of elements in the array.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">12. 2D Arrays</h2>
                <p>A 2D array is an array of arrays. Each element of a 2D array is an array itself. In other words, a 2D array is an array where each element is also an array.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">13. Associative Arrays</h2>
                <p>Normal arrays use integers as the index.</p>
                <p>Associative arrays use strings as the index. The index is often known as the key</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">14. Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a block of code that can be executed at a later time, and it can take in inputs (known as parameters)
                    and return a value as output. Functions allow you to break your code down into smaller, more manageable pieces, and reuse that code in different parts of your program.
