                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. A Brief Idea About What Web Development Is</h2>
                <p>
                    During the first week, I was given a brief idea about what web development is. To start off, web development
                    consists of 3 different roles of developers. Developers who specialize in the behaviour
                    and user interface of the site (front-end), those who write the underlying code for
                    running all website operations (back-end), and those who manage all aspects of a website
                    (full-stack). Web development involves the work of developing websites, where the web developers
                    would then publish it on the internet for users and others to view or interact with. While web
                    developers create its contents and design the websites, they are also responsible for maintaining
                    websites, as well as its technical detail, such as its performance, which are measures of a
                    website's loading speed and so on. Sites that have good performance typically have more user traffic
                    and increased conversion rates.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. The Roles of a Web Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, web development is split into 3 categories. We will now go more into detail
                    of each role of the 3 different types of web developers.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>FRONTEND DEVELOPERS</th>
                        <th>BAKCENED DEVELOPERS</th>
                        <th>FULLSTACK DEVELOPERS</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Code and design the frontend of a website. This is the part which the users see and interact with.</td>
                        <td>Working behind the scenes and maintaining the the performance and technology needed to power the front end.</td>
                        <td>Experts in both frontend and backend development.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Bring the designs to life with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</td>
                        <td>Ensure that everything the frontend developer developed is properly functioning.</td>
                        <td>Provide guidance on strategy and best practices.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Ensure responsive design throughout different devices or platforms.</td>
                        <td>Create and manage the databases.</td>
                        <td>Well-versed in both business logic and user experience.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, along with CSS and Javascript, are the 3 core pillars of front frontend development.
                    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is basically a set tags which define the structure,
                    and format of the web contents, and it utilizes tags and attributes to describe how the content of
                    a web page should be displayed or formatted.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for beautifying the
                    looks of a website. It allows users to add styles, such as colours, fonts, animations, layouts,
                    and more, to web pages. Users are able to control the layout and presentation of multiple
                    webpages at once, making it easier to maintain and update the design of their websites.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a programming language used to enable websites to be interactive. Users can add dynamic
                    behaviour, such as animated effects, and create complex features like forms, that can be submitted or
                    used to store data. It can also be used to make a website respond to user interaction, like clicking a
                    button or scrolling through the web page, allowing the user experience to be more engaging.
                </p>

                    <li>Web Gradients</li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">1. Semantic Web</h2>
                <p>
                    The Semantic Web concept is proposed to enhance way web content is shared and understood by machines.
                    The idea is to create a web where the meaning and context of the content is fully captured and represented
                    in machine-readable format, so that computers can process and understand the data efficiently.
                    Some Examples include the div element. It does not inheritently represent anything. It should be used only
                    when no ohter semantic element is appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To summarize, semantics relates to syntax. It is the meaning
                    behind words, phrases and so on. In this case, it is the HTML. Seach engines looks for keywords by looking
                    through the semantics in our codes. Therefore, it is important to have Semantic HTML as it not only make the
                    codes easier to understand, but also because screen readers (accessibility feature) and browsers can
                    interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">2. CSS Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    A CSS rule is a set of instructions that specify how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. It
                    defines the styles for font, colour, size, padding, margin, and other properties of an HTML element. The
                    CSS rule consists of two parts. A selector, which defines the HTML element to be styled, and a declaration,
                    which specifies the styles to be applied.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">3. The Different Methods to Apply CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    There are 3 ways to apply CSS to a web page. Firstly, using external stylesheets. This method involves
                    creating a seperate .css file which links it to the HTML document. This is the most commonly used
                    (and preferred) method as it allows for easy maintenance and consistency throught the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internal stylesheets can also be used. This method involves adding CSS styles within the head of the HTML 
                    document using a style tag. This method can be useful for small websites or quick testing of styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, inline styles. This method involves adding CSS styles directly to HTML elements using the "style"
                    attribute. However, this method is not recommended and should therefore be used sparingly as it goes against
                    the seperation of structure and presenation.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">4. The Different Ways to Apply Colours</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several ways to apply colours in CSS:
                </p>
                <p>- Named Colours: Using color names such as red, blue, green, etc. to specify colors.</p>
                <p>- RGB Colours: Using the RGB value to specify colors, such as rgb(255,0,0) for red.</p>
                <p>- HEX Colors: Using the hexadecimal value to specify colors, such as #FF0000 for red.</p>
                <p>- HSL Colors: Using the HSL value to specify colors, such as hsl(0, 100%, 50%) for red.</p>
                <p>- RGBA Colors: Using the RGBA value to specify colors, such as rgba(255,0,0,1) for red with full opacity.</p>
                <p>- Gradients: Using CSS gradients to create a gradual transition between two or more colors.</p>
                <p>- Transparent Colors: Using the transparent keyword to make an element transparent.</p>
                <p>
                    These color methods can be applied to different CSS properties such as background-color, color, border-color, etc. to change the appearance of an element.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">5. ID and Class Attributes</h2>
                <p>
                    ID and Class attributes are used in HTML to identify specific elements and apply styles to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ID attribute is used to give a unique identity to a specific element. Only one element can have a
                    particular ID on a page, and an ID can only be used once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Class attribute, on the other hand, is used to group elements with similar styles. Unlike the ID attribute, a class can be applied to multiple elements
                    on a page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In CSS, users can target elements with the ID attribute using the "#" symbol followed by the ID name, and target elements with the Class attribute using the "."
                    symbol followed by the Class name
                </p>
                <p>In general, ID is used when users want to target a specific, unique element, while Class is used when users want to target multiple elements with the same style.</p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">6. Pseudo Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    Pseudo classes in CSS are special keywords that can be added to selectors to select elements based on their state or position in the document. They allow users to
                    style an element in a specific way when it's in a certain state or condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, the ":hover" pseudo class allows users to change the style of an element when the mouse pointer is over it. The ":active" pseudo class allows you to
                    change the style of an element when it's being clicked. The ":focus" pseudo class allows you to change the style of an element when it has focus, such as when it is
                    selected for typing.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">7. Font Stacking</h2>
                <p>
                    Font stacking is a technique in web design where multiple font families are declared for the same element in a web page. It is done to ensure that if the first font
                    family is not available on the user's device, the next font family in the list will be used as a fallback. The idea behind font stacking is to provide an appropriate
                    and readable font for the content, even if the user's device does not have the preferred font installed.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">8. Box Model</h2>
                <p>
                    The box model is a concept in CSS that describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and the boxes' dimensions, including their
                    content, padding, borders, and margins. The box model is used to calculate the size and position of an element's content and its surrounding elements, such as padding,
                    borders, and margins. The dimensions of the boxes are used to calculate how much space an element takes up on the page, as well as how other elements are positioned in
                    relation to it. Therefore, users should understand the box model for correctly styling and positioning elements in a web page.
                </p>

                <h2 class="contentHeader">9. Web Gradients</h2>
                <p>
                    Web gradients is the use of gradient color effects in web design. A gradient is a gradual transition from one color to another. In web design, gradients can be
                    applied to elements such as background, buttons, and text to create a more visually appealing design. Web gradients can be created using CSS, and there are several types
                    of gradient effects, including linear, radial, and conic gradients. The use of web gradients helps to create a smooth, blended look and can add depth and dimension to a
                    design. Web gradients can also be used to create a unique visual identity for a website or application.
